✅ Container-Presenter Pattern (Smart-Dumb Component Architecture)
Yes, your code follows the Container-Presenter pattern:

UserContainer: Acts as the container/smart component.

Handles the logic and state using the custom hook useUser.

Passes data and handler (user, handleUser) to the presenter.

UserPresenter: Acts as the presenter/dumb component.

Purely responsible for UI.

Receives props and renders based on them.

Triggers callbacks like handleUser without owning logic.

✅ So yes, you're correctly using the Container-Presenter pattern.

✅/⚠️ SOLID Principles Analysis
Let’s walk through the SOLID principles one by one:

1. S - Single Responsibility Principle (✅)
Each component/hook has a clear responsibility:

useUser: Manages user state.

UserContainer: Bridges logic and view.

UserPresenter: Handles UI.

✅ Passes

2. O - Open/Closed Principle (⚠️)
Code is open for extension, e.g., you can enhance the UI or user object.

But it's not strictly closed for modification — if you want to change user shape, you'd need to modify all components.

⚠️ Partial: Decent, but not fully decoupled to strictly meet OCP.

3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle (✅)
Not directly relevant unless using inheritance, but all components respect the expected contract (props), so we're good here.

✅ Passes

4. I - Interface Segregation Principle (✅)
Components get only the props they need:

UserPresenter only gets user and handleUser.

✅ Passes

5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle (⚠️)
You're directly using the hook inside the container. To improve:

Consider injecting dependencies (like context or service objects).

Currently, higher-level modules depend on lower-level details.

⚠️ Partial: Could be improved with abstraction, but for most React apps, this is acceptable.

✅ Summary
Principle	Status	Notes
SRP	✅	Each unit has one responsibility
OCP	⚠️	Extendable, but user model changes ripple through
LSP	✅	Not violated
ISP	✅	Components only get what they need
DIP	⚠️	Some room for improvement with decoupling

🔷 Verdict:
You are correct in saying this follows the Container-Presenter pattern, 
and you're largely adhering to SOLID principles in a React-friendly way. 
A few architectural refinements could make it more robust, but it’s a solid foundation.







To make your code more appropriate for the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), we’ll need to:

🔁 Goal Overview
✅ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Make the code open for extension but closed for modification. That means:

Don’t modify existing logic to add new behavior.

Use abstraction or polymorphism to make logic extendable.

✅ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules (like components) should not depend on low-level modules (like state hooks) directly.

Instead, depend on abstractions, such as a service, context, or interface-like patterns.

🔧 Refactored Approach
We’ll:

Abstract user logic into a service.

Inject dependencies via a provider (React context).

Make useUser depend on that abstraction, not concrete data.

Structure the code so UserContainer can be extended without modifying internals.
